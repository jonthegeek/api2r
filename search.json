Export function functions generate R/*.R files call API, given URL OpenAPI spec YAML format (rapid::rapid() object). generated files follow encourage best practices, serve core around rest package built. Also generate tests/testthat/*.R file generated function. Generate R/*.R tests/testthat/*.R files authenticate user. Produce vignette configuring authentication. Potential challenges: Authentication complex delicate subject. APIs require registration special apps “catch” authentication requests, others simply provide API key. need carefully navigate complexities vignette. Add support APIs using OAS json format. Streamline discovery API definitions (associated error handling). Potential challenges: appear set standard API definitions posted given site. might difficult help users find right place.

Potential challenges: point ’ll need OAS definition document use testing includes possible parameter types. ’ll likely need generate fake API specification goes beyond typical individual example. Add response (return value) documentation. Use expected responses generate better test scaffolds. Potential challenges: Testing generation tests might present unique challenges. ’ll need look testthat tests . Add robust error messaging non-standard responses.
