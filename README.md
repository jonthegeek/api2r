Use beekeeper to aid in the creation and maintenance of R packages that
wrap APIs, using the information contained in the API documentation as
instructions for the package.

This package forcuses on APIs that follow the [OpenAPI Specification
(OAS)](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0). The package skeletons
generated by beekeeper implement best practices to streamline package
development.

## The Plan

This project has been accepted by the [R Consortium 2023 ISC Grant
Program](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/awarded-projects/2023-group-1#api2r:%20An%20R%20Package%20for%20Auto-Generating%20R%20API%20Clients)!

This is a rough outline of the planned development milestones of this
package, working toward a stable version 1.0.0. I had not re-read this
plan in a while, and realized I’ve been skipping to 0.4.0! I plan to
refocus and get 0.1.0 released asap.

- 0.1.0: Basic authentication and endpoint calls.
  - Export a function to generate `R/*.R` and `tests/testthat/*.R` files
    to authenticate the user and make a call to the API, given the URL
    of an OpenAPI spec in YAML format. The generated files will follow
    and encourage best practices, and will serve as the core around
    which the rest of a package would be built.
  - Produce a vignette about configuring authentication.
  - **Potential challenges:** Authentication is a complex and delicate
    subject. Some APIs require registration of special apps to “catch”
    authentication requests, while others simply provide an API key. I
    will need to carefully navigate these complexities in the vignette.
- 0.2.0: OAS definition discovery.
  - Add support for APIs using the OAS json format.
  - Streamline discovery of API definitions (with associated error
    handling).
  - **Potential challenges:** There does not appear to be a set standard
    of where API definitions are posted on a given site. It might be
    difficult to help users find the right place. Interestingly,
    <https://APIs.guru> itself has a (simple) API to aid in API
    discovery, which might provide an opportunity to use beekeeper to
    generate parts of itself.
- 0.3.0: Batching and rate limiting.
  - Add documentation for implementing batching and rate-limiting.
  - If possible, export functionality to help implement these processes,
    but standards seem to vary widely.
  - **Potential challenges:** This step will involve more reading and
    documenting than code, to gather examples of how different APIs
    implement limits and batching. It’s possible systems will be so
    different that it will be difficult to summarize them. For example,
    Slack has two separate batching systems in its API, with some
    functions moved to the newer system, and others not.
- 0.4.0: Endpoint function scaffolding.
  - Generate R/*.R and tests/testthat/*.R files for all endpoints
    (“paths”) described in the given API specification.
  - The generated functions will work, but error checking,
    documentation, and tests will be minimal.
  - **Potential challenges:** I’ll need to strike a balance here between
    getting a basic working system and producing something that can be
    easily expanded later.
- 0.5.0: More robust scaffolding.
  - Add parameter documentation.
  - Also add parameter type checking.
  - **Potential challenges:** By this point I’ll need an OAS definition
    document to use for testing that includes all of the possible
    parameter types. I’ll likely need to generate a fake API
    specification that goes beyond a typical individual example.
- 0.6.0: Expected results.
  - Add response (return value) documentation.
  - Use expected responses to generate better test scaffolds.
  - **Potential challenges:** Testing the generation of tests might
    present unique challenges. I’ll need to look into how testthat tests
    itself.
- 0.7.0: Error messaging.
  - Add more robust error messaging for non-standard responses.
  - **Potential challenges:** Mocking cases where things fail can be
    tricky. Ideally this step will involve pushing the package to a
    stable 1.0.0, but that will require enough usage to feel confident
    that the core function definitions are stable.

### Endpoint function scaffolding

This is the anticipated path to full functionality, as of 2023-07-06:

- Use {tibblify} to create an object that specifies an API. The
  structure of this object will be based on the OpenAPI Specification,
  and will contain all of the information used by this package (or
  placeholders indicating that such information is missing). This
  partially exists in the [dev version of
  tibblify](https://github.com/mgirlich/tibblify/pull/187), but needs
  more work before it will be fully ready. My intention is to create one
  or a few bespoke versions of this object in order to move forward with
  beekeeper, but I’ll simultaneously be working on making it work in
  tibblify. I currently think this object will be a list of
  lists/tibbles, but it’s possible it will be a single (nested) tibble.
- Create a wrapper in beekeeper that creates such objects and gives them
  an explicit class, `api_spec`. The idea will be that *any* API spec
  would eventually be parsable into that object (regardless of whether
  it started as an OpenAPI spec), and then that object is what we’ll
  work with within beekeeper.
- Create a function that takes an `api_spec` and creates a package.
  Build backward from here; determine which parts of the spec are
  useful, and how they need to be parsed to be easy to work with.

That general framework will make it cleaner to add different types of
spec or different implementations of the OpenAPI spec (not all specs are
perfect). That way the process is divided more cleanly into “use the
spec to generate the expected `api_spec`” and then “use the `api_spec`
to generate a package.” That also means I can guide users through steps
to manually make changes to their not-quite-perfect input in order to
generate a valid `api_spec`.
